                        <p>I am a lifelong Californian, born in San Francisco and Riverside resident since 2012. I graduated from the University of California, Riverside in 2016 with a B.A. in psychology and a minor in computer science. At UCR, I previously worked as a web programmer and performed maintenance on various UCR websites. Additionally, I oversaw the migration for websites from the Bourns College of Engineering to a Drupal content management system.</p>

                        <p>Pictured here is my family's cat Rosie, who my sister and dad adopted during the spring quarter of my freshman year of college. Considering that Rosie spends her time staring at windows, barely leaving the house, and watching syndicated television with my dad, my parents barely noticed I was in college until I graduated.</p>
        
                        <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy <s>stalking cats</s> playing Pokemon Go, assembling IKEA furniture, and reading manga.</p>
